Recalling the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea of 10 December 1982, including the obligation to protect and preserve the marine
environment,

Stressing the need to respect the balance of rights, obligations and interests set out
in the Convention,

Recognizing the need to address, in a coherent and cooperative manner, biological
diversity loss and degradation of ecosystems of the ocean, due, in particular, to climate
change impacts on marine ecosystems, such as warming and ocean deoxygenation, as well
as ocean acidification, pollution, including plastic pollution, and unsustainable use,

Conscious of the need for the comprehensive global regime under the Convention
to better address the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of
areas beyond national jurisdiction,

Recognizing the importance of contributing to the realization of a just and equitable
international economic order which takes into account the interests and needs of
humankind as a whole and, in particular, the special interests and needs of developing
States, whether coastal or landlocked,

Recognizing also that support for developing States Parties through capacity-
building and the development and transfer of marine technology are essential elements for
the attainment of the objectives of the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological
diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction,

Recalling the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,

Affirming that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as diminishing or
extinguishing the existing rights of Indigenous Peoples, including as set out in the
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or of, as appropriate, local
communities,

Recognizing the obligation set out in the Convention to assess, as far as practicable,
the potential effects on the marine environment of activities under a State’s jurisdiction or

control when the State has reasonable grounds for believing that such activities may cause
substantial pollution of or significant and harmful changes to the marine environment,

Mindful of the obligation set out in the Convention to take all measures necessary
to ensure that pollution arising from incidents or activities does not spread beyond the areas
where sovereign rights are exercised in accordance with the Convention,

Desiring to act as stewards of the ocean in areas beyond national jurisdiction on
behalf of present and future generations by protecting, caring for and ensuring responsible
use of the marine environment, maintaining the integrity of ocean ecosystems and
conserving the inherent value of biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction,

Acknowledging that the generation of, access to and utilization of digital sequence
information on marine genetic resources of areas beyond national jurisdiction, together
with the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from its utilization, contribute to
research and innovation and to the general objective of this Agreement,

Respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all
States,

Recalling that the legal status of non-parties to the Convention or any other related
agreements is governed by the rules of the law of treaties,

Recalling also that, as set out in the Convention, States are responsible for the
fulfilment of their international obligations concerning the protection and preservation of
the marine environment and may be liable in accordance with international law,

Committed to achieving sustainable development,
